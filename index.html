              <h3 class="mb-0">The Elgin Marbles</h3>
              <!---<div class="subheading mb-3">Intelitec Solutions</div> -->
              <p>
                The Elgin Marbles are named after the seventh Lord of Elgin
                who took them away from Greece. His name was Thomas Bruce.
                At that time in the early 1800s, the Ottoman Empire was
                occupying Greece. Thomas Bruce as an ambassador asked the
                Sultan for permission to take the sculptures. He then got
                a document which allowed him to take small stones. That
                document had been translated before it got to the Lord.
                He finished exporting them in 1805. Latter in 1816 the
                British Museum purchased the collection reluctantly because of legal
                reasons. The Lord of Elgin wasn't rich at the time, and
                the British Museum did not pay much. They then cleaned it
                but, when doing so, they destroyed tiny details. They did this
                because at the time they did not know that Greek sculpture
                was painted. Currently Greece has been trying to get the
                sculpture back saying that the deal was dubious. The
                British Museum says that their having the marbles helped
                enfore the Philhellenic movement. They also say that
                Greek history isn't just for Greece but Europe, too.

                The Kouroi of Klenia were illegely excavated in a village in Corinth. When
                the smugglers were found the police arrested them in 2010. The police
                say that the smugglers demanded €10,000,000 for the
                Kouroi. The two Kouroi are now located at the Archaeological
                Museum of Ancient Corinth.

              <p>The Sarpedon Krater was found in an Etruscan tomb in Cerveteri.
                It was made near Athens by the Greek painter Euphronis in 515 BCE.
                It was looted by a man named Giacomo Medici in the early 1970s.
                Looters normally destroy everything in a tomb just to find something
                valuable for the art market. The vase was purchased by an art
                dealer and then purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
                They were offered by the dealer a coverstory that it was first
                owned by a Lebanese art collector then bought by his grandfather
                before being sold to the museum. The Italian authorities found
                out but they had no legal rights to the vase. After that the
                Metropolitan Museum of Art was shamed into returning it. It is
                now located in the Etruscan Museum in Rome.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Ways to Help</h2>
          <p>
          Greek heritage is many things: a culture, a history, art, and
          information. It is being and has been pillaged, treated illegally,
          and degraded. I believe that you should take an action. A very simple
          action would be to tell your friends. Educating people and letting
          people know is a very effective way to get people to focus on this
          problem. Another effective action would be donating to an
          organization called <a href="http://savingantiquities.org">Saving
          Antiquities for Everyone (SAFE)</a>. This organization educates
          people and works with people to save antiquities. An action that
          requires more effort is to write to the <a href="https://eca.state.gov/about-bureau/contact-us">U.S. Cultural Property
          Advisory Committee</a>. They will alert the president about the issues
          involving culture and heritage. The U.S. government takes public
          opinion very seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, it is important and also easy to take an action. It
            is also important to understand that problems that include the loss
            of heritage in Greece exist.
